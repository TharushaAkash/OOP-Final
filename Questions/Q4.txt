Develop a Company-Employee Management System implementing a bidirectional association where:

The Company class maintains references to employees working in the company

Employee Class Specifications
The Employee class represents an employee with the following details:

Attributes:

employeeID (String) - Employee identifier
employeeName (String) - Employee's full name
company (Company) - Reference to the company the employee works for
Methods:

Parameterized Constructor - Initialize employee details (without company initially)

displayCompanyDetails() - Print company information and all employee details
Implement the Main Class
Create at least 4 Employee objects with different details
Create 1 Company object using parameterized constructor
Use addEmployee() to add all 4 employees to the company
Call displayCompanyDetails() to show final output
Also, demonstrate navigation from an employee to its company by calling displayEmployeeDetails() for at least one employee

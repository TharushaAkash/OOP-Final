### Question 02

In the online store, a customer can browse and purchase products. The seller manages product inventory and processes orders. Customers can add items to their shopping cart and checkout using different payment methods. Each product has a unique product code and a price that determines the cost. The system tracks order status and sends confirmation emails to customers after successful purchases.
